Hidetchi made by CouchTomato, but I made many fixes such as symmetry, remade the L & +L from scratch, etc.

A Custom Hidetchi set with filled in pieces made by me with a little inspiration of this set made by CouchTomato.

CouchTomato's latest international sets

Also boards and piece stands.

The SVG.zip contains all the sets but in svg format so you make your own custom sets and share them please.

The PNG.zip is all mentioned above and more in picture format.

#### Note: All the pieces where made by CouchTomato, but I arranged and editted them onto the ShogiGUI format so enjoy. :)

The Rook and Bishop from some sets were editted slightly by me but taken from the Lichess github.

The bona pngs where made by Shogiban.
