#### The sets are scaled 5/8 the size of physical pieces. Increase by 60% to get the size of physical pieces.
Made with Inkscape a free vector graphics software.
Also boards and piece stand.
The SVG folder contains the sets but in SVG format so you can make your own custom sets and share them please.
The PNG folder contains all mentioned above in picture format.

#### Credit: Kanji P and International pieces were made by CouchTomato, but I made them 3D, arranged and edited them onto the ShogiGUI format so enjoy. :)
